# Problems in Online Education
## High Marketing Costs 
With the rise of online education, the number of courses has surged, making market competition exceptionally fierce. Creators must exert more effort to attract and retain students while facing the issue of insufficient course visibility. Even with high-quality content, standing out among numerous courses remains a significant challenge. To effectively capture the audience and enhance course visibility, creators must invest more resources in marketing and promotion.

## High Creation Costs 
Creating high-quality courses requires significant time and effort, involving content writing, video recording, post-production editing, and testing optimization. High-quality course creation also demands top-notch recording equipment, editing software, and professional support, which can impose financial pressure on some creators.

## Copyright Verification 
Online content is easily copied and distributed, leading to widespread piracy. Course videos, e-books, music, software, and other digital content are often illegally downloaded and shared, harming the interests of creators and copyright holders. Many platforms allow user-generated content, which can lead to the upload of unauthorized copyrighted materials (such as video clips, music, images), resulting in infringement issues. Additionally, due to the global nature of the internet, infringement can occur across different countries and legal systems, complicating copyright protection and enforcement.

Course3 provides effective solutions to these problems.

# Course3
Course3 is a project jointly developed by experts from internet online education companies, Google, ByteDance, and the crypto industry, aimed at reshaping online education through Web3 technology. Built on EDU Chain, Course3 offers a range of services including a decentralized course market, course copyright verification, degree certification, learning records, and personal achievement management.

## Decentralized Course Market 
Course3 provides a decentralized educational content marketplace where teachers and content creators can publish course descriptions and catalogs before creating their courses, and set up a seed round for fundraising. Once the required funds are raised, Course3 automatically initiates asset issuance and creates corresponding Meme tokens for the course, allowing all Course3 users to participate in trading.
Students can transact directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries and reducing costs. Creators can sell courses, textbooks, and learning resources on this platform and receive fair compensation. The use of Meme tokens for decentralized issuance not only helps content creators quickly raise funds to launch course creation but also leverages Meme tokens as a medium for efficient course marketing and promotion.

## Learning Incentive System 
By creating dedicated tokens for each course, Course3 implements an incentive system for students, encouraging them to participate in course evaluations and other activities. This tokenized incentive mechanism effectively boosts student engagement and motivation. Additionally, tokens provide feedback for course creation. Since all courses are hosted on a decentralized file system, the course content will remain permanently available. High-quality course content will encourage more users to hold related tokens, providing ongoing incentives.

## Copyright Verification and Anti-Fraud System 
Course3 leverages EDU Chain's immutable characteristics to securely store student certificates, degrees, and transcripts on the blockchain. This approach effectively prevents diploma fraud, allowing employers and educational institutions to easily verify the authenticity of these credentials. Certificates issued through Course3 are recognized globally, breaking down educational certification barriers across different countries and regions, and facilitating the international acknowledgment of students' academic achievements.
Course3 also focuses on protecting intellectual property rights for courses, preventing academic plagiarism and theft. At the same time, Course3 promotes transparent sharing of course content, enabling all content creators to publish and share their course materials and research outcomes while retaining control and revenue rights for their courses.

Course3 employs a fully decentralized technology solution, providing creators with a secure and transparent platform. Uploaded educational materials, videos, and live stream content are hosted through IPFS, Arweave, and LivePeer, while EDU Chain serves as the platform for course verification and asset issuance. The architecture of Course3 includes the following layers:
- **Course Data Layer**: Responsible for the hosting of course information and resources.
- **Asset Information Layer**: Handles course verification, asset issuance, and transactions.
This layered design ensures the security of course content and effective management of assets.
